## 1. Housing Market: The "Uptown" Premium
Dallas is a city of neighborhoods. Your rent depends entirely on "The Bubble."
* **The Premium Areas:** Young professionals flock to **Uptown**, **Victory Park**, and **Deep Ellum**. These areas are walkable and fun, but rent for a 1-bedroom averages **$2,400**.
* **The "Valet Trash" Fee:** Be warned—almost every apartment complex in Dallas charges a mandatory **$25-$35/month** for "Valet Trash" service, whether you use it or not. Factor this into your budget.
* **The Suburbs:** Families move north to **Plano** or **Frisco**. You get better schools and safety, but rent is still **$1,750+** because these areas are now massive corporate hubs (Toyota, Liberty Mutual).

## 2. Utility Costs: The "Oncor" Summer Spike
Texas has a deregulated energy market (Power to Choose), but you cannot choose your delivery company.
* **The Summer Shock:** In **July and August**, temperatures hit 105°F. Your AC will run non-stop. While your energy rate might be 12 cents/kWh, the **Oncor Delivery Charges** add up. Expect bills to hit **$260+** for a 1-bedroom apartment during summer peaks.
* **The Winter Dip:** The good news? In winter, your electric bill can drop to **$80**, balancing out the year.

## 3. Hidden Costs: The Tollway Trap
Newcomers from non-toll states are often blindsided by the **NTTA (North Texas Tollway Authority)**.
* **The Dallas North Tollway (DNT):** This is the main artery from the suburbs to Downtown. It is NOT free. A round-trip commute from Plano to Downtown costs roughly **$8 per day** (with a TollTag). That is **$160/month** just to drive to work.
* **The TollTag Rule:** You *must* buy a TollTag. If you rely on "ZipCash" (pay by mail), the rates are **50% higher**.

## 4. Lifestyle & Groceries (The H-E-B Factor)
* **Groceries:** Texans are loyal to **H-E-B** (Central Market for high-end). It is generally cheaper and better quality than **Kroger** or **Tom Thumb**. A single person spends about **$480/month** on food.
* **Dining Out:** A weekend dinner in **Bishop Arts** or **Knox/Henderson** is pricey. Expect to pay **$70** for two people (tacos + margaritas).

## 5. Comparison: Is Austin Cheaper?
Many people debate between **Dallas** vs. **Austin**.
* **The Rent:** Dallas is slightly **cheaper** than Austin (roughly 5-10% less for rent).
* **The Vibe:** Dallas is "Corporate & Flashy" (Suits/Steakhouses), while Austin is "Tech & Casual" (T-shirts/Tacos).
* **The Verdict:** If you want to maximize your salary-to-rent ratio, Dallas usually wins because salaries are high but housing supply is more abundant than in Austin.

### FAQ: Living in Dallas
**Q: Do I need a car?**
A: **Yes.** The DART train exists, but it doesn't go everywhere. Dallas is a sprawling "driving city." Living here without a car is extremely difficult unless you live *and* work in Uptown.

**Q: Is it safe?**
A: Most suburbs (Plano, Frisco) are incredibly safe. In the city, areas like **Deep Ellum** can get rowdy late at night on weekends, so stay aware of your surroundings.
