## 1. Housing Market: The "Inner Loop" vs. The Sprawl
Houston is massive. Your rent price depends entirely on whether you live inside or outside the **610 Loop**.
* **The "Inner Loop" Premium:** Young professionals flock to **Midtown**, **The Heights**, or **Montrose**. These areas are walkable (rare for Houston) and full of nightlife, but you pay for it: **$1,850+** for a 1-bedroom.
* **The Commuter Suburbs:** Families and budget-conscious renters move to **Katy**, **Sugar Land**, or **Cypress**. Here, you can get a luxury apartment for **$1,350**.
* **The Trade-off:** The commute from Katy to Downtown on **I-10** is brutal. It can take 60-90 minutes each way during rush hour. Calculate the value of your time before moving out for cheaper rent.

## 2. Utility Costs: The "Swamp" Tax
Houston is humid. Extremely humid.
* **The AC Bill:** In **July and August**, your Air Conditioner will run 24/7. Bills from **CenterPoint Energy** often hit **$250+** for a standard apartment.
* **The Insulation Trap:** If you rent a trendy, renovated bungalow in **The Heights**, ask about insulation. Old homes here leak cool air rapidly, leading to shocking electric bills compared to modern complexes.

## 3. Hidden Costs: Tolls & Flooding
Houston has two massive hidden costs that don't exist in other cities.
* **The EZ TAG (Tolls):** Houston is a pay-to-drive city. If you live in the suburbs and use the **Sam Houston Tollway (Beltway 8)** or the **Grand Parkway (99)**, you will spend **$60-$120 per month** on tolls. You need an "EZ TAG" immediately to avoid fines.
* **Flood Insurance:** **CRITICAL:** Even if you rent, check the FEMA Flood Map. If you are in a flood zone, get renter's insurance that specifically covers **Flood Damage**. Standard policies do not cover rising water. This is non-negotiable in Houston.

## 4. Lifestyle & Groceries (The H-E-B Cult)
* **Groceries:** Texans are obsessed with **H-E-B**, and for good reason. It offers high quality at lower prices than national chains. A week of groceries costs about **$110**. **Whole Foods** is the expensive alternative for the "River Oaks" crowd.
* **Dining Out:** Houston has arguably the best food scene in the South. A Tex-Mex dinner on **Washington Ave** or inside the Loop costs about **$60** for two people.

## 5. Comparison: Is San Antonio Better?
Is Houston too chaotic? Many people choose **San Antonio** instead.
* **The Savings:** It is **3 hours** west on I-10, and rent is roughly **20% cheaper**.
* **The Vibe:** San Antonio is slower, more historic, and less traffic-heavy.
* **The Career Verdict:** Houston is the global capital of **Energy, Oil & Gas, and Medicine (Texas Medical Center)**. If you want high-paying corporate jobs, Houston is the superior choice.
