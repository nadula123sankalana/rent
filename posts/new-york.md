Most people move to **Manhattan** first, but it is expensive (**$3,800**). The smart move is to look at **Jersey City**. It is only **15 minutes** away by PATH, but rent is **$1,200 cheaper**. If you work from home, choose the suburb. If you work in the city center, calculate the commute cost before moving.

In New York, your biggest expense will be **heating**. In the peak months of **January** and **February**, bills spike to over **$200**. Be careful renting older apartments in **Upper Manhattan** because they often have bad insulation, which doubles your bill. Always ask the landlord for the average utility cost before signing.

A hidden cost newcomers forget is **parking fees**. If you drive daily, this adds **$50-$100** to your monthly budget. Locals avoid this by using transit, but it is hard to avoid if you live in **Queens** and commute outside Manhattan.

For groceries, **Whole Foods** is the expensive option, while **Trader Joe's** is where locals shop to save money. A week of groceries for one person costs about **$120**. For fun, a night out in **Lower East Side** will cost you about **$90** for dinner and drinks, so budget accordingly.

Is New York too expensive? Many people are choosing **Philadelphia** instead. It is only **2 hours** away, but rent is **20% cheaper**. However, New York has better jobs in the **finance** sector, so the higher rent might be worth it for your career.
