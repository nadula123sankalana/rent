## 1. Housing Market: The "Tech Tax" Effect
Rent prices in **Seattle** remain some of the highest in the nation due to the Amazon and Microsoft workforce.
* **The Premium Areas:** Living in **South Lake Union** (SLU) or **Capitol Hill** offers walkability but commands a massive premium. A standard 1-bedroom here averages **$3,050**, and parking often costs an extra **$250/month**.
* **The Budget Move:** To save money, locals are moving south to **Burien** or **Renton**. By commuting 25 minutes via I-5 or I-405, you can drop your rent to **$1,950**.

## 2. Utility Costs & The "Smoke Season"
Residents often underestimate two things about Seattle utilities: Water bills and Air Conditioning.
* **Water/Sewer/Trash:** **Seattle Public Utilities (SPU)** has some of the highest rates in the US. Expect to pay **$120+ per month** just for water and trash, even in a small apartment. (Note: Many landlords bill this separately).
* **The AC Problem:** Most older apartments in neighborhoods like **Ballard** or **Fremont** do not have AC. With recent summer heatwaves reaching 90°F+ and "Wildfire Smoke Season" in August preventing you from opening windows, a portable AC unit is now a mandatory purchase.

## 3. Transportation: The ORCA Card vs. Car
Seattle geography (water and hills) makes traffic a nightmare.
* **Car Insurance:** Drivers in Washington pay approximately **$190** per month.
* **Tolls:** If you live on the Eastside (Bellevue/Kirkland) and work in Seattle, you will cross the **SR 520 Bridge**, which uses dynamic tolling (up to $4.50 each way).
* **Public Transit:** The **Link Light Rail** is reliable for North-South travel. A monthly ORCA pass costs **$99** and is often subsidized by employers.

## 4. Food & The "Sugar Tax"
* **Groceries:** Expect to spend **$520** per month. Chains like **QFC** and **Safeway** are standard.
* **The Sugar Tax:** Be aware that Seattle has a specific tax on sweetened beverages. A case of Gatorade or Soda can cost **$5-$8 more** inside city limits than it does in the suburbs.
