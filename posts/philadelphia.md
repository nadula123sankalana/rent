Most people move to **Center City** first, but it is expensive (**$2,100**). The smart move is to look at **Upper Darby**. It is only **20 minutes** away by car, but rent is **$600 cheaper**. If you work from home, choose the suburb. If you work in the city center, calculate the gas cost before moving.

In Philadelphia, your biggest expense will be **heating**. In the peak months of **January** and **February**, bills spike to over **$200**. Be careful renting older apartments in **South Philly** because they often have bad insulation, which doubles your bill. Always ask the landlord for the average utility cost before signing.

A hidden cost newcomers forget is the **sugar tax**. If you drive daily, this adds **$50-$100** to your monthly budget. Locals avoid this by shopping in the suburbs, but it is hard to avoid if you live in **Center City**.

For groceries, **Whole Foods** is the expensive option, while **Aldi** is where locals shop to save money. A week of groceries for one person costs about **$100**. For fun, a night out in **Fishtown** will cost you about **$80** for dinner and drinks, so budget accordingly.

Is Philadelphia too expensive? Many people are choosing **Baltimore** instead. It is only **1.5 hours** away, but rent is **20% cheaper**. However, Philadelphia has better jobs in the **healthcare** sector, so the higher rent might be worth it for your career.
