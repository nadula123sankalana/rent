Most people move to **The Gulch** first, but it is expensive (**$2,200**). The smart move is to look at **Murfreesboro**. It is only **35 minutes** away by car, but rent is **$700 cheaper**. If you work from home, choose the suburb. If you work in the city center, calculate the gas cost before moving.

In Nashville, your biggest expense will be **air conditioning**. In the peak months of **July** and **August**, bills spike to over **$200**. Be careful renting older apartments in **East Nashville** because they often have bad insulation, which doubles your bill. Always ask the landlord for the average utility cost before signing.

A hidden cost newcomers forget is **parking fees**. If you drive daily, this adds **$50-$100** to your monthly budget. Locals avoid this by using park-and-ride lots, but it is hard to avoid if you live in **Downtown**.

For groceries, **Whole Foods** is the expensive option, while **Kroger** is where locals shop to save money. A week of groceries for one person costs about **$100**. For fun, a night out on **Broadway** will cost you about **$80** for dinner and drinks, so budget accordingly.

Is Nashville too expensive? Many people are choosing **Knoxville** instead. It is only **2.5 hours** away, but rent is **20% cheaper**. However, Nashville has better jobs in the **music** sector, so the higher rent might be worth it for your career.
